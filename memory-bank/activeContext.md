## Current Task
Deep Momentum Trading System - Memory Bank Setup Complete ✅

## Project Overview
This is a sophisticated algorithmic trading system that uses deep learning models (LSTM and Transformer) for momentum-based trading strategies. The system includes:
- Real-time data processing from Polygon API
- Advanced risk management and portfolio optimization
- Distributed model training and ensemble systems
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Multi-storage backend support (HDF5, Parquet, SQLite)

## Session Accomplishments
1. ✅ Memory Bank system fully initialized and operational
2. ✅ System architecture documented in productContext.md
3. ✅ Project configuration established with .clinerules
4. ✅ Critical syntax errors fixed in test_trading_pipeline.py
5. ✅ Code quality verified with syntax compilation

## Recent Changes
- Memory Bank directory structure created with all core files
- Fixed syntax errors in deep_momentum_trading/tests/integration/test_trading_pipeline.py
- Created .clinerules configuration for project standards
- Established comprehensive project documentation

## System Status
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Syntax errors resolved, compilation successful
- **Memory Bank**: ✅ Fully operational with context preservation
- **Documentation**: ✅ Architecture and progress tracking established
- **Configuration**: ✅ Project rules and standards defined

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Install project dependencies (pytest, torch, etc.)
2. Run comprehensive test suite to assess system health
3. Analyze model performance and training pipeline
4. Review risk management implementation
5. Evaluate data pipeline efficiency and optimization opportunities

## Memory Bank Usage
- Use `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` prefix in Code mode for context-aware development
- Memory Bank automatically preserves context across sessions
- All major decisions and progress tracked in respective files
