## Memory Bank System - Initial Setup Decisions

### Decision: Memory Bank Architecture
**Date**: 2025-05-23  
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive Memory Bank system for deep momentum trading project  
**Rationale**: 
- Complex trading system requires persistent context management
- Multiple components and subsystems need coordinated documentation
- Development workflow benefits from systematic progress tracking
- Team collaboration enhanced through shared project knowledge base

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple README-based documentation (Rejected - insufficient for complex system)
- External documentation tools (Rejected - adds complexity and separation from codebase)

### Decision: Memory Bank File Structure
**Date**: 2025-05-23  
**Decision**: Use standard 4-file Memory Bank structure (activeContext.md, productContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md)  
**Rationale**:
- Proven structure for complex software projects
- Clear separation of concerns between current context, product knowledge, progress tracking, and decision history
- Scalable for future project growth

**Implementation Details**:
- activeContext.md: Current session goals, open questions, immediate context
- productContext.md: System architecture, technologies, standards, long-term project knowledge
- progress.md: Work completed, current tasks, roadmap, metrics
- decisionLog.md: Technical decisions, architectural choices, rationale documentation

### Decision: Immediate Priority - Code Quality Issues
**Date**: 2025-05-23  
**Decision**: Address syntax errors in test_trading_pipeline.py as immediate priority  
**Rationale**:
- Syntax errors prevent proper testing and development workflow
- Test suite integrity critical for trading system reliability
- Code quality issues can cascade into larger problems

**Identified Issues**:
- Line 723: Missing except/finally block after try statement
- Line 782: Missing colon in if __name__ statement

**Next Actions**:
- Fix syntax errors immediately
- Run comprehensive test suite to verify system health
- Assess overall code quality and identify additional issues

### Decision: System Assessment Approach
**Date**: 2025-05-23  
**Decision**: Conduct systematic analysis of trading system components  
**Rationale**:
- Complex system requires thorough understanding before modifications
- Risk management critical in trading applications
- Performance optimization needs baseline measurements

**Assessment Areas**:
1. Code quality and syntax validation
2. Test suite coverage and functionality
3. Model performance and training pipeline
4. Risk management implementation
5. Data pipeline efficiency
6. System monitoring and alerting
7. Infrastructure and deployment

### Decision: Documentation Standards
**Date**: 2025-05-23  
**Decision**: Maintain comprehensive documentation within Memory Bank system  
**Rationale**:
- Trading systems require detailed documentation for compliance and maintenance
- Complex ML/AI components need clear architectural documentation
- Team knowledge sharing essential for system reliability

**Standards**:
- All major decisions documented in decisionLog.md
- Architecture changes reflected in productContext.md
- Progress tracking maintained in progress.md
- Session context preserved in activeContext.md

## Future Decision Areas

### Pending Decisions
- **Model Optimization Strategy**: Need to assess current model performance and identify optimization opportunities
- **Risk Management Enhancement**: Evaluate current risk controls and identify improvements
- **Scalability Planning**: Determine system scaling requirements and implementation approach
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Assess current monitoring capabilities and identify gaps
- **Testing Strategy**: Evaluate test coverage and identify areas for improvement

### Decision Criteria Framework
For future decisions, consider:
1. **Risk Impact**: Effect on trading system reliability and financial risk
2. **Performance Impact**: Effect on system latency and throughput
3. **Maintainability**: Long-term code maintenance and team productivity
4. **Compliance**: Regulatory and business requirements
5. **Scalability**: Future growth and system expansion needs
6. **Cost-Benefit**: Development effort vs. expected benefits
